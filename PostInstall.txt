You can add Ruby-based unit tests to any iPhone/Xcode project by changing to the 
project's folder in the terminal/console and running:

	rbiphonetest .

This adds the test framework, a Rakefile, and an `autotest` config file.

You can now create testable Objective-C models/classes using the generator:
	
	$ script/generate model WidgetMaker
		  create  Classes/WidgetMaker.h
		  create  Classes/WidgetMaker.m
		  create  test/test_widget_maker.rb

To run tests you have several options:
	
1. `rake` or `rake test`
1. `autotest` (after installing the ZenTest gem)

Enjoy iPhone development with Ruby!
